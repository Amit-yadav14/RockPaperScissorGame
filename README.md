A rock-paper-scissors game in Python, console-based, is a simple yet entertaining project.
Here's a brief overview of what such a project might entail:

User Input: Prompt the user to input their choice (rock, paper, or scissors) using the console.

Computer Choice: Generate a random choice for the computer (rock, paper, or scissors).

Comparison: Compare the user's choice with the computer's choice to determine the winner. Implement the logic for determining the winner based on the rules of the game (rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock).

Display Results: Display the result of the game to the user, indicating whether they won, lost, or it was a tie.

Loop: Allow the game to be played multiple times by putting the main logic inside a loop. Prompt the user if they want to play again after each round.

Scorekeeping: Keep track of the user's and computer's scores throughout the game and display them after each round or at the end of the game.
